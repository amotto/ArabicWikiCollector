# ArabicWikiCollector
Small Python module that grabs a random Arabic Wikipedia article and returns Arabic text from it.

Using write_article_to_file() you can write the contents of the random article to a file. The file name is an MD5 hash of the contents.
Use get_article() if you just want to return the text.

This module was made to aid in data collection for an Arabic dataset.
